# Younitec Test Task

Please fork this repos, solve the test and send us a link to checkout your solution. GitHub is free, Visual Studio Community as well
The following things must be made within the unit test solution:
* Spend maximum 2 hours for the task
* In the example we want to merge data of “n” files into one list. Each file should be like a column.
* Check the solution first. If there are any questions or something does not work, ask me before starting the following tasks.
* Read the comments within “DBF/DbfTestTask.cs”. There the desired code is described. Add your code in the existing or new files (however you would do it). Asking is fully ok (you got my email)
